    <h3 id="p0">1. V for Vendetta</h3>
    <p id="p0"><img src="../images/vendetta.jpeg" height="300"></p>
    
    <p>
      <h4>Why I recommend it:</h4> Stylistic and thought-provoking. V for Vendetta is a cautionary tale of
      totalitarianism in the not-so-distant future with epic fight sequences that
      remind you of the Matrix.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="p0">2. Spirited Away</h3>
    <p id="p0"><img src="../images/ghibli.jpeg" height="300"></p>
    
    <p>
      <h4>Why I recommend it:</h4> Nostalgic and breathtaking. A great introduction into the fantastical world of
      Hayao Miyazaki. An eleven year old girl forced by her
      parents to move to a rural countryside stumbles across an
      ancient bathhouse for spirits and other supernatural beings.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="p0">3. The Truman Show</h3>
    <p id="p0"><img src="../images/truman.jpeg" height="300"></p>
    <p>
      <h4>Why I recommend it:</h4> Tragic but funny. What if one day you discover your life is a TV show and you
      are its unwitting star? Jim Carrey delivers his comedic antics as a
      man and his gradual unravelling over the realization that nothing in his life is real.
