    <h3 id="p0">1. V for Vendetta</h3>
    <p id="p0"><img src="../images/vendetta.jpeg" height="300"></p>
    
    <p>
      <h4>Why I recommend it:</h4> Stylistic and thought-provoking. V for Vendetta is a cautionary tale of
      totalitarianism in the not-so-distant future with epic fight sequences that
      remind you of the Matrix.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="p0">2. Spirited Away</h3>
    <p id="p0"><img src="../images/ghibli.jpeg" height="300"></p>
    
    <p>
      <h4>Why I recommend it:</h4> Nostalgic and breathtaking. A great introduction into the fantastical world of
      Hayao Miyazaki from the eyes of an eleven year old girl who is forced by her
      parents to move to rural countryside and stumbles across an
      ancient bathhouse for spirits and other supernatural beings.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="p0">3. The Truman Show</h3>
    <p id="p0"><img src="../images/truman.jpeg" height="300"></p>
    <p>
      <h4>Why I recommend it:</h4> Tragic but funny. What if one day you discover your life is a TV show and you
      are its unwitting star? Jim Carrey delivers his usual comedic acting about a
      man's gradual unravelling over his realization that nothing in his life is real.
